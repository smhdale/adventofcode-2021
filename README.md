# Advent of Code 2021
Back at it again, this time only 10 days late!

---

### **Setup**
Not much to it really. Just run:
```sh
npm install
```

---

### **Running the code**
Also pretty simple:
```sh
npm run day [number]
```

---

### **About**
* Yet again we're using [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) because I'm too late to the party to work out how to use deno.
* I've used [Volta](https://volta.sh) again because it's the great, you should use it too.
* Like last year: ESLint + Prettier make code good with no think.
